# Final Project

## Customer Loyalty Points Exchange System

### Description: 

Most companies have their own unique loyalty points to reward their customers. The problem with this is that customers can only use points at the same companies and not others. Furthermore, sometimes this points expire before the customer has the opportunity to use the points. In an ideal world, the customer would have full ownershipt of their loyalty points. They should be able to use their loyalty points anywhere and they should be able to gift points or sell them if they choose to do so.

### Project

1. Customers can win rewards points that are stored in the blockchain
2. Customers can use this points with any merchant they like
3. Customers have full ownership of the points and they don't expire
4. Customers have the freedome to give away or sell points if they choose to
